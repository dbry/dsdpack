Experimental lossless DSD compressor.

Builds on Linux, and probably Windows and OS X with very minimal (if any)
changes. Includes command-line program and a module for each of the three
modes (fast, normal, and high). Note that the normal (default) mode does
NOT provide a good balance of compression and performance and is only
provided as a reference; use only the fast or high modes depending on your
needs.

Note that this is a "raw" compressor in that it does not process any headers
or non-dsd data. However, since it is lossless, any headers present in the
files will be preserved, and in fact the programs could be used with ANY
type of arbitrary file (although usually with dismal results).

Since it is "raw", the data must be formatted in a specific way, and that
way happens to be the way that Philips DSDIFF files are formatted. In other
words, the data is straight bytes for mono, interleaved bytes for stereo,
and the MSB of each byte is considered first temporily (and LSB last,
obviously). Files in Sony's DSF format will have to be unblocked (if stereo)
and the bytes will need to be reversed. Multichannel files are not handled.

Since there is no header processing mono files cannot be detected, so there
is a command-line switch to specify that (stereo is the default).

 Version: 0.4.1

 Usage:   DSDPACK [-options] infile outfile

 Options: -d  = decode
          -1  = mono mode (encode only)
          -2  = stereo mode (encode only, default)
          -f  = fast mode (encode only)
          -h  = high mode (encode only)

 Warning: EXPERIMENTAL - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!
